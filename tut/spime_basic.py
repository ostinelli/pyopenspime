###### Imports
import sys, os
os.chdir(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(sys.argv[0])))
sys.path.append('../lib') # use the local library
from pyopenspime.core import Client

###### PyOpenSpime
# Create new client -> bind log callback function
c = Client('spime@developer.openspime.com/spime')

# Connect to OpenSpime SpimeGate
c.connect()

###### Data
# Create data reporting message which requests for confirmation (i.e. of type 'iq')
import pyopenspime.extension.datareporting
dr = pyopenspime.extension.datareporting.ExtObj()

# Add node
dr.add_entry(u"""<entry>

    </entry>""")

# build message of kind 'iq', i.e. will wait for a confirmation or error message.
iq = dr.build('iq')

###### Callback function
def on_success(stanza_id, stanza):
    print(u'data with id \'%s\' succesfully received by recipient.' % stanza_id)
c.set_iq_handlers(on_success)

###### Send
c.send_stanza(iq, 'scopenode@developer.openspime.com/scope')

###### Listening loop (client up)
try:
    while c.loop(1):
        pass
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    log.info(u'disconnecting and exiting')
    if c.connected == True:
        c.disconnect()
